Changelog
Initial public release — January 2026
– Finalised the reference architecture across Core Concepts, Sectors, Trust & Safety Standards, Interfaces and Market, establishing a stable analytical layer model for the documentation of service robotics.
– Defined Service Robotics as a distinct technical and economic field, aligned with ISO 8373:2021 terminology and institutional usage, and explicitly delimited from industrial automation, medical robotics and vendor-specific classifications.
– Formalised three cross-sector evaluation pillars — Human–Robot Interaction, Autonomous Task Execution, and Operational Reliability — as recurring analytical dimensions used throughout the reference.
– Established a vendor-neutral, non-commercial editorial scope focused on structural description, classification and documentation; product comparisons, promotional content and speculative projections are explicitly excluded.
– Implemented a machine-readable semantic layer using structured schema.org markup to link definitions, sector taxonomy and reference structure for consistent human and machine interpretation.
– Documented sector taxonomy for service robotics based on deployment environments, functional demands and governance conditions, aligned with recurring institutional reporting practices.
– Published transparency statements on data handling, privacy scope and the editorial use of AI as a supporting tool, clarifying operational boundaries and governance principles.
– Introduced an editorial revision policy restricting updates to changes in underlying definitions, standards or classification models; no continuous news coverage or trend reporting is performed.
Note:
Minor technical adjustments (e.g. accessibility fixes, performance optimisations, asset compression or infrastructure changes) are intentionally not recorded here, as they do not affect the conceptual, semantic or editorial integrity of the reference.
