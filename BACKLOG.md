# Backlog — Future Clarifications and Extensions

This document lists potential future clarifications, extensions or contextual additions
identified after the initial public release (v1.0).

Items listed here are **not commitments**.
They will only be addressed if they meet the project’s stability,
source verifiability and scope criteria.

---

## Candidate Items (Unscheduled)

### Definitions & Scope
- Clarification of service robot categorisation in ISO 8373 revisions
  (industrial / service / medical robot separation)
  — requires precise clause referencing and source validation.

- Explicit autonomy definition mapping
  (linking ISO 8373 autonomy wording to operational interoperability discussion).

### Standards & Ecosystem Context
- Structured positioning of ISO TC 299, IFR statistical publications
  and sector-specific standards within the existing standards map.
  — qualitative framing only, no quantitative benchmarks.

### Data & Market References
- Conditional integration of high-level market indicators
  (e.g. professional service robotics deployment trends).
  — only with primary source citation and temporal scoping.

### Interfaces & Machine-to-Machine Perspectives
- Deeper treatment of schema-based M2M interoperability
  (e.g. schema.org, non-normative vocabularies).
  — requires clear separation from normative standards.

## Governance Note
